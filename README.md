# POV-TEOE
Project 2 of the Computer Graphics Class

Files:
- Fractal image files are the fractals we generated. We ended up using the number 2

- Rock.png, Sand.png and montana.png are the textures used.

- Julia.sce is the file used to generate the fractal

- Project-scene-* are some of the images rendered from the project

- genMountain.sce and genMountain2.sce contain code for creating the height matrix. We decided to use the genMountain for our project.

- palm-shinji.inc is the palm object used

- matrix_sand.in and Matrix_Sand_2.in are height matrixes for the sand. We used Matrix_Sand_2.in since it was a larger matrix

- Mandelbrot.sce is an example we got from the internet. We didn't use it at all.

- genTerrain.cpp is the file that generates the .inc file of the object. Used to generate mountains and sand.

- sandGenerator.cpp is the file that generates the height matrix for sand.

- terrain_mountain_1.inc and terrain_mountain_2.inc	are the 2 mountains used in the project.

- terrain_sand.inc is the plane used for the sand.

- texturas.inc is the file that has the textures we used.

- proyecto.pov is the POV project.
